"""In-process optimization worker (plan.md §0: no Redis yet).

The API commits a `queued` run and then calls `OptimizationRunner.submit`.
The run is solved on a worker thread (`asyncio.to_thread`, CP-SAT is
CPU-bound) and its outcome written on a service connection, which bypasses
RLS: this is a trusted system job, and `planned_assignments` /
`recommendations` have no user write policies.

Railway restarts the process on every deploy, so runs can be orphaned:
`recover_stale` (on startup) and the API (before answering 409) mark runs
stuck in queued/running for longer than `OPTIMIZER_STALE_AFTER_S` as failed.
